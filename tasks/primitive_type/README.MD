Certainly! Here are some TypeScript tasks and small projects that focus on using only primitive types for implementation:

1. **FizzBuzz Implementation**:
   Implement the classic FizzBuzz problem using TypeScript. Print numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz." Use primitive number types and string types for this task.

2. **Palindrome Checker**:
   Create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Use only primitive string types and implement the necessary logic to determine if the string is a palindrome.

3. **Factorial Calculator**:
   Build a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using an iterative approach. Use a primitive number type for input and output, and implement the factorial calculation logic.

4. **Prime Number Checker**:
   Develop a program that checks if a given number is prime. Use a primitive number type and implement the logic to determine whether the input number is divisible only by 1 and itself.

5. **Character Frequency Counter**:
   Implement a program that counts the frequency of characters in a given string. Display a histogram showing the occurrences of each character. Use primitive string and number types for this task.

6. **Vowel and Consonant Counter**:
   Create a program that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given string. Use primitive string and number types, and implement logic to identify and count vowels and consonants.

7. **ASCII Art Generator**:
   Build a program that converts a given string into ASCII art by using primitive string types. Each character in the input string can be represented as a block of ASCII characters to create a visual representation of the text.

8. **Roman Numeral Converter**:
   Develop a program that converts a given number to a Roman numeral representation. Use primitive number types and implement the logic to generate the Roman numeral equivalent.

9. **Random Password Generator**:
   Create a program that generates random passwords of a specified length. Use primitive string types for character sets and generated passwords.

10. **Binary to Decimal Converter**:
    Implement a program that converts a binary number to its decimal equivalent. Use primitive string and number types and implement the logic to perform the conversion.

These tasks and projects focus on using only primitive types and basic operations to achieve specific goals. They provide valuable practice in working with primitive data types and foundational programming concepts.
