Certainly! Here are some TypeScript tasks and small projects that focus on using different types (besides primitive and object types) for implementation:

1. **Enum-based Card Game**:
   Create a simple card game using TypeScript's `enum` type. Define an `enum` for card suits and values, and implement logic for shuffling and dealing cards.

2. **Tuple-based Data Storage**:
   Build a program that stores and displays data using TypeScript's `tuple` type. Define a `tuple` to represent data entries with different data types, such as a name and an age.

3. **Union-based Search Filter**:
   Develop a search filter using TypeScript's `union` type. Implement a function that accepts a search query and filters through different types of data (e.g., strings, numbers) to find matching results.

4. **Intersection-based Shopping Cart**:
   Create a shopping cart application that utilizes TypeScript's `intersection` type. Define types for products and cart items, and use intersections to combine properties from both types.

5. **Type Guard-based Authentication System**:
   Build a simple authentication system using TypeScript's type guards. Define types for authenticated and unauthenticated users, and implement type guards to manage user access.

6. **Mapped Type Currency Converter**:
   Develop a currency converter using TypeScript's mapped types. Define a mapped type that associates currency codes with their respective exchange rates, and implement a function for currency conversion.

7. **Conditional Type Quiz App**:
   Create a quiz application that utilizes TypeScript's conditional types. Define types for quiz questions with varying structures (e.g., multiple choice, true/false) using conditional types.

8. **Partial and Readonly-based Configuration Manager**:
   Build a configuration manager using TypeScript's `Partial` and `Readonly` utility types. Allow users to modify a configuration object by specifying which properties to change, while ensuring the object's immutability.

9. **Pick and Omit-based Form Validator**:
   Implement a form validator using TypeScript's `Pick` and `Omit` utility types. Define a type for form fields, and create utility functions to pick and omit properties for validation and display.

10. **Nullable-based API Response Handler**:
    Create an API response handler using TypeScript's nullable types. Define types for successful and error responses, and implement logic to handle both cases while ensuring null safety.

These tasks and projects focus on utilizing TypeScript's advanced type features to solve specific challenges and scenarios. They provide opportunities to practice working with different type constructs to enhance the functionality and robustness of your applications.
