Certainly! Here are some TypeScript tasks and small projects that focus on using combined types (intersection, union, conditional types, etc.) for implementation:

1. **Combined Type Calculator**:
   Build a calculator that supports both numbers and strings as operands using union types. Implement functions for addition and multiplication that work with both types.

2. **Shape Recognizer**:
   Create a program that recognizes shapes based on their properties using intersection types. Define types for properties like sides and angles, and implement logic to recognize shapes like squares, triangles, and circles.

3. **User Authentication System**:
   Implement a user authentication system using union types and type guards. Define types for different user roles and use unions to represent possible user profiles. Implement type guards to check user roles.

4. **Multi-Language Greeting App**:
   Build an app that greets users in different languages using mapped types. Define a mapped type that associates languages with corresponding greetings, and implement a function to display greetings in different languages.

5. **Conditional Type Chatbot**:
   Create a chatbot that responds differently based on user input using conditional types. Define types for different user commands and use conditional types to determine appropriate responses.

6. **Weather Recommendation App**:
   Develop an app that recommends activities based on weather conditions using union types. Define types for weather conditions and activities, and implement logic to suggest activities based on the current weather.

7. **State Management with Discriminated Unions**:
   Build a state management system for a simple application using discriminated union types. Define types for different states and actions, and implement reducers to manage state transitions.

8. **Quiz Application with Conditional Type Questions**:
   Implement a quiz application that generates questions based on user preferences using conditional types. Define types for different question types and implement logic to generate appropriate questions.

9. **Combined Type API Response Handler**:
   Create an API response handler that handles both successful and error responses using union types. Define types for success and error responses, and implement functions to process both types of responses.

10. **Type-safe Form Validation**:
    Build a form validation system that uses conditional types to ensure type safety. Define types for form fields, validation rules, and error messages, and implement type-safe validation logic.

These tasks and projects focus on combining different types to create more versatile and complex structures that solve various challenges. They provide opportunities to practice using TypeScript's powerful type system to enhance the functionality and reliability of your applications.
