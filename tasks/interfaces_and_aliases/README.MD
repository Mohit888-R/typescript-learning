Certainly! Here are some TypeScript tasks and small projects that focus on using interfaces and type aliases for implementation:

1. **Contact Management App with Interfaces**:
   Build a contact management application using interfaces to define the structure of contact objects. Implement features like adding contacts, searching for contacts, and displaying contact details.

2. **Product Catalog with Type Aliases**:
   Create a product catalog application using type aliases to define product structures. Implement functions to add products, calculate total prices, and display product information.

3. **Shape Calculator with Interfaces**:
   Implement a shape calculator that computes area and perimeter using interfaces to define different shape structures. Support shapes like squares, circles, and triangles.

4. **Weather Forecast App with Type Aliases**:
   Build a weather forecast application using type aliases to define the structure of weather data. Fetch weather data from an API and display forecasts for different locations.

5. **Todo List with Interfaces and Type Aliases**:
   Develop a todo list application using interfaces for tasks and type aliases for different task statuses. Implement functions to add, complete, and display tasks.

6. **Employee Management System with Interfaces**:
   Create an employee management system using interfaces to define employee structures. Implement features to add employees, update employee information, and display employee details.

7. **User Authentication with Type Aliases**:
   Build a user authentication system using type aliases to define user roles and authentication data structures. Implement logic for user login, registration, and role-based access control.

8. **Recipe Collection with Interfaces and Type Aliases**:
   Develop a recipe collection using interfaces for recipes and type aliases for ingredients. Implement features to add new recipes, search by ingredients, and display recipe details.

9. **Social Media Profile App with Interfaces**:
   Implement a social media profile application using interfaces to define user profile structures. Allow users to create profiles, update information, and view profiles.

10. **Budget Tracker with Type Aliases**:
    Create a budget tracking application using type aliases to define income and expense structures. Implement functions to add income and expenses, calculate totals, and display financial summaries.

These tasks and projects focus on using interfaces and type aliases to define structured data and improve the organization and readability of your code. They provide opportunities to practice working with TypeScript's type system to create robust and maintainable applications.
