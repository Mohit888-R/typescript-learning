Certainly! Here are some TypeScript tasks and small projects that focus on using arrays for implementation:

1. **Array-based Todo List App**:
   Build a simple todo list application using arrays to store and manage tasks. Implement features such as adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, and displaying the list of tasks.

2. **Array-based Student Grade Tracker**:
   Create a program that tracks student grades using arrays to store course grades. Implement functions to calculate average grades and display student information.

3. **Array-based Contact Book**:
   Develop a contact book application using arrays to store contact information. Implement features to add contacts, search by name, and display contact details.

4. **Array-based Shopping Cart**:
   Build a shopping cart application using arrays to store cart items. Implement functions to add items, calculate the total price, and display the cart contents.

5. **Array-based Data Filtering**:
   Implement a program that filters data using arrays. Read data from a source, use array methods to filter based on specific criteria, and display the filtered results.

6. **Array-based Library Catalog**:
   Create a library catalog application using arrays to store book information. Implement functions to add books, search by author, and display available books.

7. **Array-based Task Scheduler**:
   Build a task scheduling application using arrays to manage tasks. Implement functions to add tasks, mark them as completed, and display upcoming tasks.

8. **Array-based Word Frequency Counter**:
   Develop a program that counts the frequency of words in a given text using arrays to store word counts. Display the most frequent words and their occurrences.

9. **Array-based Quiz Game**:
   Create a quiz game using arrays to store questions and answers. Implement functions to display questions, gather user input, and calculate the score.

10. **Array-based Sorting Algorithms**:
    Implement various sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort) using arrays. Compare the performance and behavior of different sorting methods.

These tasks and projects provide opportunities to practice working with arrays, utilizing array methods, and implementing different features using array data structures. Arrays are a fundamental concept in programming, and mastering their use is essential for effective data manipulation and algorithmic understanding.
